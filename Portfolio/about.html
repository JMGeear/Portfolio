    <p>My name is Jeff Geear and I was born in Toronto, Canada. I am an aspiring programmer and one of 
    the lead singers and guitarists for the rock band Viraltone.</p>

    <p>My computer abilities to troubleshoot hardware and software problems, work as a team player, and 
    meet deadlines combined with my attention to detail would contributed to my success.  I possess web 
    programming skills, Java programming skills, DB2, C#, MySQL, PHP, skills in business writing, an 
    outstanding knowledge of Microsoft Office including Project and Visio.  I am skilled at working with 
    others to provide information and solutions to potential and existing issues.  My outgoing and 
    friendly nature allows me to interact well with other individuals at all levels and I am able to 
    bridge the gap between technical and non-technical persons.</p>

    <p> I was introduced to music at an early age and after a couple of years taking Piano lessons I 
    switched to guitar. My father gave me my first guitar which was a beat up six string acoustic with a 
    really warped neck. I studied music at the Carlaw Conservatory of Music for five years. I remember 
    when I bought my first guitar. It was a black Washburn electric, which I still have and play today. 
    That guitar never left my side. I played in bands after High school but we eventually ended up going 
    our separate ways. My interest in computers began with a Commodore 64. It wasn’t until I attended 
    college that I really began to use computers and realized the limitless potential of the computer age.</p>
